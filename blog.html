        <h1>Assignment 1 reflection</h1>
        <b>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</b>
        <p>
            The problem that I found is that setting up the environment to write code is so confusing. I work through them by going to peer tutoring who help me set up environment for coding. 
        </p>
        <b>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</b>
        <p>
            I learn that some of the repository like this one, I cannot clone it to my device directly but I can use git hub desktop to clone it which is weird.
        </p>
        <b>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</b>
        <p>I still cannot find Campuswire forum of this class but I went to Peer tutoring to help me work through this assignment</p>
