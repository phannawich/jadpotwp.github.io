        <b>A description of the most interesting fact about you or the most unique experience you've had</b>
        <p>The most unique experience that I had last summer is that I did not plan on doing anything last summer except travelling and
            chill because it is my first term but my friend just invite me to seminar for Thai student in USA which got me the internship job 
            as research assistant. What I did is doing the research about traffic prediction model which is sound crazy, I have a change to use Pytorch to build AI.
            That is the thing that sky rocket my knowledge as a summer of freshmen.
